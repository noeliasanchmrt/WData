# Methodology

This section details the statistical methods and approaches implemented in WData for weighted data analysis.

## Weighted Means and Proportions
Standard formulas are adapted to incorporate weights, allowing for unbiased estimators when data are not equally representative.

## Inference Procedures
- Confidence intervals are constructed using weighted estimators and appropriate variance formulas.
- Hypothesis tests are adjusted for weighted samples using survey statistics techniques.
