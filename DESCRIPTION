Description: Set of tools for analyzing and modeling data that may be
    subject to biases in sampling. It offers functions to estimate density
    functions, cumulative distribution functions, and quantiles from
    biased samples of a continuous distribution. Regarding density
    function estimation, the package includes Bhattacharyya et al. (1988)
    and Jones (1991) density estimators and various bandwidth selectors
    for Jones (1991) density estimator, enhancing the flexibility and
    adaptability of density estimation to different types of datasets and
    biases. For cumulative distribution function estimation, the package
    includes the empirical estimator proposed by Cox (2005) and the
    kernel-type estimator by Bose and Dutta (2022), along with several
    bandwidth selectors for the latter. For quantile function estimation,
    it provides two empirical estimators (one of which corresponds to
    Sen’s (1984) proposal) and one kernel-type estimator. Additionally,
    for sparsity function estimation, the package includes the two
    estimators proposed by Akbari et al. (2019) (one plug-in and one
    kernel-type), as well as a third kernel-type estimator. Moreover, it
    offers functions for simulating datasets given a bias function and a
    reference distribution, providing users with the ability to generate
    synthetic datasets for various modeling and analysis purposes. It also
    includes functions for constructing boxplots and QQ plots for biased
    data, facilitating graphical exploration. Finally, the package
    includes Muttlak’s (1988) real length-biased dataset on shrub width as
    an example dataset.
