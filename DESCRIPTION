Description: Set of tools for analyzing and modeling data that may be
    subject to biases in sampling. It offers functions to estimate density
    function and cumulative distribution function from a biased sample of
    a continuous distribution. Regarding density function estimation, the
    package includes @bhattacharyya1988 and @jones1991 density estimators
    and various bandwidth selectors for the latter, enhancing the
    flexibility and adaptability of density estimation to different types
    of datasets and biases. For cumulative distribution function
    estimation, the package includes the empirical estimator proposed by
    @cox2005 and the kernel-type estimator by @bose2022, along with
    several bandwidth selectors for the latter. Finally, the package
    includes @muttlak1988 real length-biased dataset on shrub width as an
    example dataset.
