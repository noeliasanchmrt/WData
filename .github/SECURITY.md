If you discover a security issue, please bring it to our attention right away!

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **DO NOT** file a public issue to report a security vulnerability. Instead, send your report privately to **noelia.sanchez.martinez@rai.usc.es**. This will help ensure that any vulnerabilities that are found can be [disclosed responsibly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure) to any affected parties.

## For R CRAN Package Users

If the vulnerability affects the CRAN version of the package, please also consider notifying the CRAN team at [cran@r-project.org](mailto:cran@r-project.org) after contacting us, following [CRAN's security policy](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html#Security).

We will work to address any security issues as quickly as possible and coordinate with CRAN for timely updates.
