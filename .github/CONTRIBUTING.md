## Code of Conduct

Please review our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). It is in effect at all times and must be honored by everyone who contributes to this project.

## Asking Questions

See our [Support Guide](./SUPPORT.md). GitHub issues are for reporting bugs and requesting features, not for general support or debugging your own project.

## Opening an Issue

Before [creating an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue), check if you are using the latest version. If not, update first to see if your issue is resolved.

### Reporting Security Issues

Review our [Security Policy](./SECURITY.md). **Do not** file public issues for security vulnerabilities.

### Bug Reports and Other Issues

- **Review the documentation and [Support Guide](./SUPPORT.md)** before opening a new issue.
- **Do not open duplicate issues.** Search existing issues first.
- **Use reactions** (👍) instead of "+1" comments.
- **Fully complete the issue template.** Provide clear, concise, and descriptive information, including steps to reproduce, error messages, versions, and screenshots if applicable.
- **Use [GitHub-flavored Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github)** for code and console output.

## Feature Requests

Feature requests are welcome! We consider all requests, but cannot guarantee acceptance or implementation timelines. You are welcome to submit a pull request.

- **Do not open duplicate feature requests.** Search first.
- **Fully complete the feature request template.**
- Be precise about the proposed outcome and relation to existing features. Include implementation details if possible.

## Triaging Issues

You can help by reproducing bugs or asking for more information (e.g., version numbers, reproduction steps). Any help is appreciated!

## Submitting Pull Requests

We welcome pull requests! For non-trivial changes, open an issue first to discuss your approach.

- **Smaller is better.** Submit one pull request per bug fix or feature. Avoid unrelated refactoring.
- **Coordinate bigger changes.** Discuss large changes with maintainers before starting.
- **Prioritize clarity over cleverness.** Write clear, understandable code.
- **Follow existing coding style and conventions.**
- **Include test coverage** where possible.
- **Update documentation** and example projects if needed.
- **Update the CHANGELOG** for enhancements and bug fixes.
- **Use the repo's default branch** for pull requests.
- **Resolve any merge conflicts** that occur.
- **Promptly address CI failures.**
- Write comments with proper sentences and punctuation.
- Use spaces, not tabs.

## Writing Commit Messages

Please [write clear commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/):

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
1. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
1. Capitalize the subject line
1. Do not end the subject line with a period
1. Use the imperative mood in the subject line (e.g., "Fix networking issue")
1. Wrap the body at about 72 characters
1. Use the body to explain **why**, not what/how
1. If applicable, prefix the title with the relevant component name (e.g., "[Docs] Fix typo")

## Code Review

- **Review the code, not the author.** Suggest improvements respectfully and explain your reasoning.
- **You are not your code.** Accept constructive criticism.
- **Always do your best.** Learn from mistakes.
- Kindly note any violations of these guidelines.

## Coding Style

Consistency is key. Follow the style, formatting, and naming conventions of the file and project. If in doubt, ask or search the codebase for examples. Style and format may be enforced with a linter.
